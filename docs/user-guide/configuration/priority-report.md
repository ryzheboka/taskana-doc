# Priority Report

TASKANA provides the possibility to customize Priority Reports in the UI. To configure it, go to “Settings” in the TASKANA UI. 

![setting](../static/configuration/UISettings.png)

Currently the UI supports the following types of parameters: 

|Type     | What the UI shows                                          |Usage
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----
|text     |an input field where text can be typed in                   |Priority names
|interval |two input fields for numbers, a lower and an upper boundary |Priority intervals
|color    |a color picker                                              |Priority colors
|json     |a text area where a string in json format can be typed in.  |Filter values

### Placement of this configuration in TASKANA
The parameters described above are saved in the CONFIGURATION table under CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES. The data structure is divided in two parts: The fields with their corresponding values and a field named “schema”. That field contains all information which is needed in the UI to display those parameters. The default values can be found there.
